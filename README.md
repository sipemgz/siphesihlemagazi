- 👋 Hi, I’m @siphesihlemagazi, a Python and Django Backend developer.
- 👀 Though currently mainly using Python/Django, I’m interested in the whole Software Engineering verse, using other tools and technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, the Microsoft Power Platform, Javascript, Python, Django, CSS, HTML, as well as Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on website and web app development, preferably as a backend developer using Python/Django.
